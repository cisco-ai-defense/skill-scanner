# Example Custom Rule Pack
#
# This is an example of an external rule pack that adds custom detection
# rules to skill-scanner.  Place this directory anywhere on disk and
# pass it to the scanner via --rule-packs:
#
#   skill-scanner scan ./my-skill --rule-packs ./examples/custom-rule-pack/
#
# The pack manifest (this file) declares all rules and their default knobs.
# The scanner merges these defaults with your policy YAML overrides.
