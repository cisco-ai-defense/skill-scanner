# User Guide

Skill Scanner ships as a CLI tool, a Python library, and a REST API. This section covers day-to-day usage for all three interfaces, plus scan-policy tuning and configuration.

## What are you trying to do?

- **[Scan a skill locally](./cli-usage)** -- Run the CLI against a skill directory on your machine or in a CI pipeline.
- **[Embed scanning in Python](./python-sdk)** -- Import the SDK to scan skills programmatically inside your own applications.
- **[Integrate via REST API](./api-server)** -- Upload skill ZIPs over HTTP for CI/CD, web portals, or service-to-service workflows.
- **[Tune detection sensitivity](./scan-policies-overview)** -- Choose a preset policy or write custom YAML to control which rules fire and at what severity.
- **[Pick a configuration for your use case](./recommended-settings)** -- What we recommend for local development, CI gates, vetting third-party skills and registry-scale scanning, why, and how to set it up.
